Looking at the packet traffic, we see that there are multiple different UDP streams
going to various destinations. Looking through each one, we find that the UDP stream
from 10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.12 contains characters for the flag. Using Wireshark's Follow UDP stream
functionality, we can get the entire flag:

picoCTF{StaT31355_636f6e6e}
