Attempting to view the flag will tell us that we're not using "picobrowser", and shows us our browser's user agent.
There's no real browser that will have the user agent "picobrowser", so we need to send our own
request and forge the user agent ourselves.

I decided to use curl, which will give us the full page containing the flag
$ curl -A "picobrowser" https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21851/flag
