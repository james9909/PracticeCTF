The given image contains several different flag-like symbols, and we can tell from the fact
that there are are curly braces that each symbol probably represents a single character.
It turns out that there's already a flag-like alphabet used by sailors for communicating between ships
that use these exact symbols. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags)

Using this alphabet, we can decode the flag:
PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}
