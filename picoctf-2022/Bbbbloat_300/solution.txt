Decompiling the binary we get the following source:

```
    function_1140("%d", (int64_t *)&v3, 0xd2c49, 0xd2c49);
    if (v3 != 0x86187) {
        // 0x1583
        function_10f0("Sorry, that's not it!", 0xd2c49, 0xd2c49);
```

0x86187 is hex for 549255, and inputting that into the program gives us the flag.
