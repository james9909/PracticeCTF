Torrents have an info hash that can identify the file that is being downloaded. Given that the first few packets suggest that we're torrenting
from Ubuntu we can safely guess that this hash would be wide enough known for us to Google.

$ xxd torrent.pcap | grep info -A2
...
03c34fe0: 93b7 863a c1aa 393a 696e 666f 5f68 6173  ...:..9:info_has
03c34ff0: 6832 303a e246 7cbf 0211 92c2 4136 7b89  h20:.F|.....A6{.
03c35000: 2230 dc1e 05c0 580e 6531 3a71 393a 6765  "0....X.e1:q9:ge

So the info hash is e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e and inputting that into Google will give us the file name.
