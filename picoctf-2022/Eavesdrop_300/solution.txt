Looking through the traffic we see a conversation between two people over the transfer of an encrypted file.

Earlier in the conversation we see the following command for decryption:
openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123

Later we see that the file is being sent on port 9002 and with the recognizable `Salted__` header for OpenSSL.
Extracting that data out and decrypting it with the command from above gives us the flag:
picoCTF{nc_73115_411_5786acc3}
