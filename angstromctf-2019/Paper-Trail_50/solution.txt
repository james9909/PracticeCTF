Looking at each packet, we see that it starts with the following messages:

defund!~defund@ec2-18-209-123-192.compute-1.amazonaws.com PRIVMSG defund :I have to confide in someone, even if it's myself
defund!~defund@ec2-18-209-123-192.compute-1.amazonaws.com PRIVMSG defund :my publications are all randomly generated :(

The next messages are all one character each, which create the flag when combined.
