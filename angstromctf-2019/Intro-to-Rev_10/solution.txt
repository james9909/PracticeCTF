Welcome to your first reversing challenge!

If you are seeing this, then you already ran the file! Let's try some input next.
Enter the word 'angstrom' to continue:

Good job! Some programs might also want you to enter information with a command line argument.

When you run a file, command line arguments are given by running './introToRev argument1 argument2' where you replace each argument with a desired string.

To get the flag for this problem, run this file again with the arguments 'binary' and 'reversing' (don't put the quotes).
