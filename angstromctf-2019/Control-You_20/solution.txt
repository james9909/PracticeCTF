Looking at the source code for the webpage, we can see the function stop() being called when the button is clicked,
which checks the value of the input box against a constant string, which suspiciously looks like the flag.

function stop() {
    if (flag.value === "actf{control_u_so_we_can't_control_you}") {
        document.body.style.background = "red";
    }
}

Therefore, the flag is actf{control_u_so_we_can't_control_you}
